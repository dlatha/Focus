Focus

A simple Go app that runs on localhost to redirect every request you make to social media website to localhost. 

At the moment it only does simple redirects but the following are features that will be added on redirect:
1. Display a quote or inspirational Gif
2. Show a ToDo Item that you can edit
3. A plus sign that lets you add more websites and remove ones that are already added.

Another feature that is desired is an icon on the top menu bar to start and stop the focus time. This should also send notifications to user when the focus time is up.



If you would like to contribute with any new features. Please feel free to open a PR. :)
